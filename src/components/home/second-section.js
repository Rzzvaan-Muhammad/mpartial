                    mpartial relieves you of the burden of manually sketching
                    and hammering in all the mundane and repetitive line items.
                    Your productivity will skyrocket as you finally have the
                    time to thoughtfully adjust/estimate in the way you always
                    knew you could, but never had the time. Our computer vision
                    powered deliverables are designed to do ~80% of the heavy
                    lifting for you, the remainder is where you, the human get
                    to show these machines why organic life forms are still
                    relevant in claims. #RaceWithTheMachines
