Steps and ramps are constructed to provide easy access to places that are a bit higher than usual places. Any path that comprises an incline is potentially risky and exhausting to people with limited mobility.

Steps are usually difficult for people who have disabilities and are impossible for wheelchair users. Conversely, for some people who have limited mobility, steps can be preferable to ramps. Careful designs for outdoor steps are very essential to ensure that they are easily accessible to everyone.

#### Steps and Ramps:

External steps should always be manufactured in conjunction with ramps to provide choices and paths that are usable by everyone.

According to the majority of building codes, outdoor steps and ramps should not adjoin but attach to a structure. Steps can be attached with support hangers and a ramp through a ledger. These both must have a concrete footing at the base level. The footing can be narrow and installed over a simple layer of pea pebbles to allow for drainage. These steps and ramps may also require a handrail.

#### Constructing Steps:

Usual outdoor steps are built up of two or three stringers and threads. The first thing while constructing stairs is to figure out the total rise and total run of the steps. Now, what is the total rise? It is the distance from the ground to the structureâ€™s beginning and the height of each step is unit rise. Total run is how far out the steps will range. It can be calculated by using basic mathematics.

#### What to Avoid When Constructing Steps?

Careful designing of outdoor steps is very important to make sure that people are finding no difficulty in using steps.

While constructing outdoor steps, make sure to avoid a couple of things. Avoid single steps as these are easily overlooked by people. Because of single steps people could fall and hurt themselves. Secondly, avoid ramped steps and angled steps as these are difficult to use for the majority of people. People could slip or fall off the angles and ramped steps.

#### Steps Design Details:

The steps are a bit scary. While building steps keep in mind that the step riser should not exceed 150mm and avoid open risers. Step tread should not be less than 280mm.
Visual Contrast:

Steps should contrast graphically with the background. Using paints and contrasting materials for highlighting step nosing is very essential. Highlights should be approximately 55mm deep and extended full with the width of the step.

#### Step Series:

Step series is an important point in constructing steps. Steps should be varying within the series, with consistent risers and footsteps. Each flight should be of 1,2m at maximum.

#### Constructing Ramps:

In the construction of ramps, no threads are used. If we compare the construction of ramps and stairs, building ramps is much easier. At first, simply determine your required slope. Measure the vertical rise per linear foot in inches. Then the stringer is cut accordingly. A normal ramp for wheelchairs is built 1-in-12.

#### Ramp Length:

Ramp length should be 1:20 at a maximum incline and it should not exceed 10m. A level resting platform approximately 1.8m long should be delivered at least every 30m on sustained inclines of more than 1:20.

#### Protection of Ramps:

Frequently used ramps should be protected by a roof overhang or overhead canopy. Protecting ramps are very important for their long term use.

#### Maintenance:

Ramps require regular maintenance. Daily maintenance is essential to guarantee that ramps are usable and safe for a longer period. Maintenance, in particular, means the elimination of wreckages and debris. Clearance of snow and ice in winter also includes regular maintenance.

Materials Required in Construction of Ramps:

The type of material people choose depends on what people want to construct. Commercial ramps construction requires materials like wood, aluminum, steel, and concrete.

- Wooden Ramps:

Wood is usually not very expensive. Many owners prefer the aesthetic of a wood ramp over a metal one. Wood ramps provide a quainter feel to the building.

- Aluminum Ramps:

Aluminum ramps are great for manufacturing customizable access solutions and are maintenance-free too. The aluminum ramps can be fixed at the location in a matter of hours as their parts are shipped pre-made. It is ideal for temporary and permanent solutions.

Aluminum ramps last almost forever and will face the harshest of environments along with the repeated everyday use. These ramps also provide safe access for all individuals.

- Steel Ramps:

Steel ramps permit for a design that provides customization for any sort of property.

- Concrete Ramps:

If you are looking for low maintenance ramp options then concrete ramps are the best-suited option for you. It is also very durable and life longing. These ramps can bear high load and high weight. It is great for everyday use of the ramp.

Materials Used In Construction of Stairs:

There are around 11 standard woods that are used in building steps. People also use customized varieties of materials to construct steps.

- Pine:

Southern pine is the most known material to construct steps. This material has good strength and is inexpensive.

- Carpet Grade:

This material is used for the construction of steps that intend to be covered in carpet. These are ideal for basement steps because it is the place where aesthetic matters the most. This material is knotty and has various color variations.

- Stain Grade:

If you are looking for uniform grain and minimal small knots that stain grade is the ideal option for you. This is best-suited for the minimum finished staircase.

- Stone Steps:

These steps are heavy and need strong support. These are preferred for grounds like approach to basements etc. These steps are found where ashlar stones are easily available.

- Timber Steps:

Timber steps are light and easy to build but are very poor in fire resistance.

These are built where abundant wood is available. These stairs are used only in mow-rise buildings.

- Steel Steps:

Steel steps are of a special type and mainly used in factories, workshops, and godowns, etc. these are made up of pre-stressed sheet steel that is strong and fireproof. Steel steps are also known as lubricated steps.

- Concrete Steps:

Concrete steps are used as an alternative to stone steps. These are mostly used for the entrance to the buildings.

#### Service Cost:

The cost of building a ramp depends on the material you are using. Some people use concrete to build up ramps. Concrete ramps cost around $200 to $250. Wooden ramps will range you from $100 to $250. Aluminum ramped will charge you about $150. Steel and metal ramps also cost around $200 to $250. Prefabricated aluminum ramps are the cheapest and cost around $100.

Similarly, the cost of constructing steps depend upon the materials being used. Steps installation's national average cost is around $3,696. On average people pay $2,000 to $5,000 depending on the requirements. The lowest price for the installation of steps is $1,077 and it can go as high as \$9,236.

#### Conclusion:

Steps and ramps are essential elements in any building whether it is home or business. These allow people to climb from one floor to another and provide access to lofts and basements.
