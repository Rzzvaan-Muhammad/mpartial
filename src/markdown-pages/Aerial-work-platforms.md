#### What Is An Aerial Work Platform?

Aerial work platforms or you can say AWPs are the most common, economical, and manageable models that can lift two or more workers. There are several other names for these machines. People also know them by mobile elevating work platforms, man lifts, personnel lifts and push-around, etc. Workers mostly go for these lifts as they are the least expensive personnel lifts. These are commonly used for overhead maintenance work and cleaning and hanging high signboards etc. These lifts are manually driven. An individual can easily move these lifts around the entire workspace.

#### Different Types of Aerial Lifts:

Here are some most common types of construction lifts and other aerial work platforms that are commonly used by people.

- Scissor Lifts:

These lifts are structured in a crisscrossed manner and so they are called scissor lifts. The crisscrossed metal supports the expansion during the levitation of the platform and contracting during the depressing of the platform. They support laborers in reaching the hard-to-reach areas. These lifts provide excellent support and balance to workers. These scissor lifts are further classified into electronic models. These electronic models are used for flat surfaces as well as rough terrain versions.

- Material Lifts:

Material lifts usually consist of modifiable forks or platforms to support and guide the load during raising, lowering, and transporting. The models are available for different purposes. They are used in installing and maintaining air ducts and light fixing. These machines serve as forklifts or hand trucks and help in setting up lights and sound systems at indoor and outdoor locations.

- Boom Lifts:

Boom lifts are also known as cherry pickers. These types of aerial platforms have a bucket or platform attached to a hydraulically motorized crane system. This enables workers to get access to higher altitudes. There are two classifications of boom lifts. One is a straight telescopic boom. These telescopic booms perform well at outdoor locations and help in reaching places that are not easily reachable. The other one is articulated knuckle booms. These pivot for extra flexibility and elasticity.

- Vertical Personnel Lifts:

These personnel lifts are also known as man lifts. These are one-person machines. These machines can elevate labor safely so that they can perform installation, restoration, maintenance, and other similar tasks. They usually work in closed platforms to secure workers from falling out. These lifts are the best option for working at heights under 50 feet.

Whenever you go for buying something, the very first thing that comes to your mind is the pros and cons. Similarly, when choosing aerial platforms, choose wisely. Here is why people mostly choose Aerial Work Platforms.

- Budget-friendly:

Aerial Work Platforms are economical. These lifts are a good substitute for scissor lifts. These are affordable and light on the pocket.

- Transportable:

The aerial work platforms save your energy as they are super easy to move all around the working space. These are portable and controllable.

- Lightweight:

They are comparatively light in weight and ideal to use on floorboards that only support limited weights.

- Simple Machine:

These lifts are very simple to manage and easy to operate. These APWs are for one person set up.

- Multipurpose:

These lifts can be customized according to your required application. These offer multiple options and fittings. They are profitable due to the customizability and flexibility to suit your workplace needs.
Applications of Aerial Lifts:

It is right that aerial work platforms are the most essential equipment for industries. These lifts enable laborers to work safely even at heights.

Aerial Work Platforms are not only used for particular industries or jobs. These are widely used by manufacturing companies to get access to overhead components and to reach behind large equipment. General workers use these lifts to reach high regions when doing repairs and construction. For construction companies, aerial work platforms are the most essential piece of equipment. Rescue crews get benefited the most from aerial lifts. They use these lifts to reach buildings to rescue people and other things. Contractors use them for interior and external uses. In a nutshell, aerial work platforms offer reliable access to higher ranges.

- Aerial Lifts In Construction Sites:

On construction sites, aerial work platforms are the most needed equipment. These aerial lifts have become an ideal alternative to scaffolding. For excellent safety, contractors rely on aerial lifts as they not only guarantee safety but also provide work efficiency. APWs greatly help in reducing worker intensity during aerial work construction.

- Installation Of Equipment In Complex Environment:

If you have any sort of special construction conditions, then aerial work platforms are best-suited for you. These lifts not only shortens the construction period but also reduces the safety risks that most likely occur when using a traditional high-altitude operation method.

- Installation Of Pipeline:

These lifts are also used in indoor high-altitude operations. These help in installing fire-fighting pipelines and here are many operation points and complex operation spaces. These lifts are height-adjustable and at the same time help in carrying materials and other construction equipment to the working point. APWs greatly eliminate construction difficulties and improve the safety and productivity of installation work.

- Supermarket and Warehouse Arrangement:

In this modern age supermarkets, warehouses and logistics centers have become larger. Multi-layer stacking has become the need of the time. These multilayer stacking aerial work platforms are best-suited. The traditional forklift can also perform the required task but it is not as safe and efficient as the aerial lifts. The aerial work platform is even more necessary especially when the staff has to reach a high place to complete the cargo operation.

- Manufacturing and maintenance of Large Equipment:

Ships, aircraft, and other large equipment require bendable operational heights and positions during their manufacture, fitting, and repairs. The aerial work platform is the best choice for these tasks. Especially during shipbuilding and repair plants, heavy tools are required at the work point, these aerial lifts always come to the rescue.

#### Service Cost:

Aerial work platforms are widely used around the globe. Aerial lift cost depends upon the model you buy. These aerial work platforms can cost you as low as $5,100 and as high as $80,000. The more weight you need to lift, the higher the price will be.

Aerial lifts are also easily available for rental services. Daily rental services begin from $295 and rise to $2,120. If you are planning to rent out an aerial lift for a week, you can expect to pay around $650 to $4,900.

#### Conclusion:

In the present age, Aerial Work Platforms are the most convenient option for working at high-altitudes. These are super easy to operate and adapt according to workplace requirements. Especially for the contractors who work in high-altitudes on a daily basis, this machine has become their need.
